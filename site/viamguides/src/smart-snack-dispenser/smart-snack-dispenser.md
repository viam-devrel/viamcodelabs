## Set up your Raspberry Pi
Duration: 5

Before embedding the Raspberry Pi in the food dispenser, you will prepare it with an operating system.

The Raspberry Pi boots from a USB flash drive (or microSD card). You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on a storage device that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the USB flash drive (or microSD card) to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.webp)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the storage device you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.webp)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `test`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
   ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/generalSettings.webp)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
   ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/sshSettings.webp)
   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on your storage device. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to your storage device.
1. Remove the storage device from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the storage device into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
   > aside negative
   > Make sure you are using a 5V 3A USB-C power supply to power your Raspberry Pi 4. Using a power supply with inadequate amperage can lead to instability, throttling, or unexpected behavior. Additionally, while USB boot is enabled by default on newer Raspberry Pi 4 models, older versions may require a firmware update to enable it. Refer to the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html) for detailed setup instructions and compatibility.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
   ```bash
   ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
   ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
   ![raspberry pi SSH login](assets/sshLogin.webp)
1. Update your Raspberry Pi to ensure all the latest packages are installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

Now that you've confirmed the Raspberry Pi is set up with an operating system, you can shut it down with the following command in the SSH session on the Pi:
```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

The SSH session will close as the Raspberry Pi begins to turn off.
Once the green activity light stops blinking, you can unplug the Raspberry Pi from power to prepare assembling the hardware in the next step.

## Set up the hardware
Duration: 20

It's time to get your hands dirty by taking apart the food dispenser and upgrading the internals with the Raspberry Pi and other peripherals!

### Disassemble the snack dispenser

1. Remove the food bowl from the base of the dispenser and set it aside. 
   ![food dispenser without bowl](assets/hardwarePrepped.webp)
1. Turn the dispenser upside down to access the screws on the bottom of the device.
   ![flip the machine](assets/hardwareFlip.webp)
1. Use the screwdriver to remove the screws in each corner. Set them aside in a safe place for later when reassembling.
   ![unscrew base](assets/hardwareUnscrew.webp)
1. **Carefully**, flip the device over again with the food container (hopper) facing up. Slowly, lift the container to separate it from the base of the device and expose the internal wiring.
   ![separate container from base](assets/hardwareDisassemble.webp)

### Prepare hardware components

1. Using the wire strippers, cut the wires connected to the motor and limit switch on the bottom of the food container.
   **Make sure to keep around 6 inches of wire connected to each component.** This will make it easier to connect them to the other hardware peripherals later.
   ![cut motor, switch wires](assets/hardwareComponentWires.webp)
1. Using the wire strippers, cut the power (typically red) and ground (typically black) wires connected to power port at the bottom of the base.
   **Make sure to keep around 6 inches of wire.** This will make it easier to connect them to the other hardware peripherals later.
   ![power wires](assets/hardwarePowerWires.webp)
1. For each of the cut wires, use the wire strippers to expose about half a fingernail's length of metal from the plastic covering. Take your time and pull slowly to remove only the plastic.
   ![stripped wire](assets/hardwareWireStripped.webp)
1. Set the food container part aside now that it is disconnected from the base. Place the base on its front so the back of the device is facing up.
   Put on safety glasses and use the drill to slowly bore a hole in the base a couple inches from the bottom. Make sure you have a secure grip to prevent it from spinning while drilling. It should enter the base just above the power port.
   ![camera cable hole](assets/hardwareCameraCableHole.webp)
1. This hole will be used by the webcam's USB cable to connect to the Raspberry Pi once it is embedded in the food dispenser. Test it by pushing the USB end through several inches.
   If there are any issues, use the drill to widen the entry point with a bigger drill bit or by slowly rotating the existing bit around the inside of the hole while the drill is running, applying light pressure to strip away material.
   ![test camera entry](assets/hardwareCameraCableEntry.webp)
1. Clean out any plastic material from the drilling process from the inside of the base and place the base with the bottom down to prepare for wiring.

### Connect hardware components

![wiring diagram](assets/wiring.webp)

1. Use the above wiring diagram to connect the hardware peripherals and power together. The stripped wires from the snack dispenser can be connected to the jumper wires using the WAGO lever nuts.

   _The ordering of the motor wires are not important, which is why the naming used in the above table is vague._

   > aside positive
   > The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi. When working with Viam, make sure to reference the physical pin numbers, and not the GPIO numbers listed on `pinout.xyz`.
1. Feed the webcam USB cable through the entry hole you drilled earlier and connect it to any of the Raspberry Pi's USB-A ports.
   ![fully wired machine](assets/hardwareAllWired.webp)
1. Carefully tuck the Raspberry Pi into the side of the dispenser base, keeping the wires clear of the stand-off pillars for the top container.
   ![embedded Raspberry Pi](assets/hardwareBoardEmbedded.webp)
1. Place the top container (hopper) on the base, making sure the logo is facing the front of the device so it dispenses correctly.
1. Sit the webcam on the top of the hopper, facing down towards the bowl (after adding the bowl back to the base).
   ![machine assembled](assets/hardwareCompleted.webp)

Nice work! 👏 

Now you can connect power to the food dispenser to turn on the Raspberry Pi. Lift the top container from the base to peek at the Raspberry Pi, looking for the red power light and blinking green activity light.
