### Pre-workshop checklist ✅

Review these setup steps as you're planning the workshop to help prepare for it.

1. **Planning and Logistics**
   - **Verify equipment inventory:** Decide which materials are provided or required for participants to bring on their own. Order any materials and supplies that are provided to participants.
   - **Confirm workstation setup**: Verify the workshop room layout supports hardware work, such as tables for wiring the components. Ensure participants have power outlets and internet access. Have spare supplies, such as Raspberry Pis, adapters/readers, and cables, in case of failures. For virtual workshops, confirm logistics for breakout sessions, providing support, and checkpoints.
   - **Communicate prerequisites**: Share a participant guide prior to the workshop with learning objectives and instructions for installing software and preparing laptops. Provide a checklist for participants to confirm readiness.
   - **Establish support channels**: Determine how participants can get support for real-time troubleshooting (e.g. Slack or Discord channel for virtual workshops, additional helpers in the room for on-site workshops).
   - **Request Viam stickers**: Don't forget [to request Viam stickers](https://forms.gle/TFXBm7L9n8U4hLRj9) for the workshop.
1. **Content Preparation**
   - **Prepare workshop teaching materials**: Review the Delivery Plan, sample slide deck, and provided resources. Tailor these materials to suit your participants' needs. Decide whether to present them to the group or provide them for independent reference, such as through a web browser or printed handouts.
   - **Determine extensibility**: During the Hands-on Experiment portion of the delivery plan, there are many options to guide the workshop on a different learning path. Determine if this section will be self-guided exploration, a group exercise, or self-paced learning for participants to explore on their own after the workshop.
   - **Prepare code and documentation**: Review the provided code and add comments as necessary.
   - **Review discussion topics**: Review the suggested group discussion topics and adjust for your participants.
   - **Review quiz questions**: Review the suggested quiz questions and adjust for your participants. Determine if knowledge assessment will be completed throughout the workshop or afterwards.
1. **Dry Run and Testing**
   - **Test the workshop project**: Run through the build following the prepared documentation to ensure it works as expected. Simulate common issues and prepare troubleshooting tips for these scenarios. If physical space is limited, consider sharing a Raspberry Pi.
   - **Bring backups**: Final check to bring the backup supplies mentioned earlier during planning.

## Delivery Plan - Hardware Assembly

Duration: 30

### Set up your Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi boots from a USB flash drive (or microSD card). You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on a USB flash drive that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the USB flash drive (or microSD card) to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.png)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the USB flash drive you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.png)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example `test` shown here. Each Pi should have a unique `hostname` to avoid conflicts on the shared local network, such as `&lt;student-name&gt;-detection` or `&lt;group-name&gt;-detection` if working in groups.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
   ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/generalSettings.png)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
   ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/sshSettings.png)
   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on the USB flash drive. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to the USB flash drive.
1. Remove the USB flash drive from your computer when the installation is complete.

</form>

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the USB flash drive into a USB port on your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
   ```bash
   ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
   ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
   ![raspberry pi SSH login](assets/sshLogin.png)
1. Update your Raspberry Pi to ensure all the latest packages are installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

### Set up your machine peripherals

1. **Connect the webcam**: Connect the webcam's USB lead to any USB port on your Pi. The webcam transmits video data to the Raspberry Pi through the USB interface.
1. **Connect the piezo buzzer**: The passive piezo buzzer can be controlled via a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi. Refer to the following wiring diagram to connect the Raspberry Pi to the piezo buzzer.

![wiring diagram](assets/wiring.png)

- Pin 35 (GPIO 19) to Positive

</form>

### Configure your piezo buzzer

You can manually and programmatically use the GPIO pins of the [`board`](https://docs.viam.com/components/board/) component to send PWM signals to control your buzzer. However, to streamline this next step, let's use a prebuilt module.

1. In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **CONFIGURE** tab, click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component**.
1. Select `generic`, and find the `buzzer:piezo` module. This adds the module for controlling your buzzer. Name the component `piezo`.
   ![select piezo component](assets/addPiezo.png)
1. In the new `piezo` panel, configure your component by adding the following attributes in the **CONFIGURE** field. This tells your piezo component to use a specific pin (physical pin 35) on a specific board (called `board-1` in the Viam app) that you wired in a previous step.
   ```json
   {
     "piezo_pin": "35",
     "board": "board-1"
   }
   ```
1. Select your board `board-1` from the **Depends on** field.
   ![configure piezo](assets/configurePiezo.png)
1. Click **Save** to apply your configuration changes. This may take a moment.
1. Since we are using a generic component, let's test it out under the **CONTROL** tab. Find your `piezo` component on this page. Expand the **DO COMMAND** field, input the following code, and hit **Execute**.
   ```json
   {
     "sound_buzzer": {
       "frequency": 1200,
       "duration": 1.5,
       "duty_cycle": 0.7
     }
   }
   ```
   ![test piezo](assets/testPiezo.png)
   You are executing a [`DoCommand`](https://docs.viam.com/components/generic/#api) on a generic component that has been predefined to accept parameters such as `frequency`, `duration`, and `duty_cycle`.
   > aside negative
   > Since we are using a passive buzzer, you must provide a [PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) signal to generate different tones. A constant high signal will not produce a sound as they would for an active buzzer, since passive buzzers require varying frequencies to produce audible tones.
1. Experiment with different values in those fields to see what happens when you execute the command again. If you have extra time, try sending the following Do command.
   ```json
   {
     "play_harry_potter": {}
   }
   ```

> aside negative
> **TROUBLESHOOTING**: Double check the wiring on your piezo component. Also check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.

<form>
  <name>What is the primary purpose for using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control a passive piezo buzzer?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="To provide a constant high voltage to the buzzer.">
  <input type="radio" value="To generate varying tones by controlling the frequency of the signal.">
  <input type="radio" value="To make sure the buzzer operates at a fixed tone without additional wiring.">
  <input type="radio" value="To power the buzzer directly from a USB port.">

## Delivery Plan - Hands-on Experiment

Duration: 40

### Program your people detector

At this point, the Vision Service relies on the ML Model Service to analyze visual data. It uses pre-trained machine learning models, such as `EfficientDet-COCO`, to perform tasks like object detection. Currently, many objects are being detected in the camera feed.

In this section, we'll write code to alert us when a person is detected. And if a person is detected, the piezo buzzer will sound.

![process diagram](assets/diagram.png)

### Create an automation script

1. To configure your machine to automatically run a command that executes a script, use a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/). Start by creating a new file called `process.py` on your computer.
   On MacOS, Linux, or Windows WSL:

   ```bash
   touch process.py
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```cmd
   type nul > process.py
   ```

1. Copy and paste [this sample code](https://github.com/loopDelicious/viam-people-detection-process/blob/main/process.py) into the newly created `process.py` file. This code connects your Raspberry Pi to the Vision Service and piezo component to execute the automation logic.
1. Transfer the `process.py` file to your Raspberry Pi. First, [SSH into your Raspberry Pi](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#connect-with-ssh) if you aren't already connected.
1. On your Raspberry Pi, install the Python package manager (pip) using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
   ```

1. Install the Viam Python SDK into a new directory called `detector`.
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install --target=detector viam-sdk
   ```
1. Display the full path of your current directory on your Raspberry Pi using the `pwd` command. Take note of the output, as you'll need it in the next steps. The output should include the path to the newly created `detector/` directory:
   ```bash
   $ pwd
   ```
1. Find the executable path for Python3 on your Raspberry Pi using the `which python3` command. Note this output as well, as it will be required for running `process.py`.
   ```bash
   $ which python3
   ```
1. Copy the `process.py` file from your computer to your Raspberry Pi using the `scp` command. Replace `user` and `host.local` with your Raspberry Pi's username and hostanme (or IP address). The part after the colon (`:`) specifies where the file should be copied on the Raspberry Pi, including the `detector/` directory. Make sure you run the command from your computer (not the SSH prompt for your Raspberry Pi).
   ```bash
   $ scp process.py user@host.local:/home/myboard/detector/process.py
   ```
   ![scp from command line](assets/scp.png)

<form>
  <name>What is the primary role of the `process.py` script in the people detection system?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="To collect camera data from the Raspberry Pi.">
  <input type="radio" value="To define the logic for periodically checking the camera data and turning on the piezo based on detections.">

### Configure a Viam process

Now let's configure `viam-server` to run the process as the root user on your Raspberry Pi by setting up a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/).

1.  In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations), go to the **CONFIGURE** tab. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Process**.
    ![add process](assets/addProcess.png)
1.  Find the card for `process-1`. Enter the following:

    - The executable path for Python3 on your Raspberry Pi (from a previous step).
    - The `process.py` file as an argument.
    - The working directory where the process should execute (from a previous step).
      ![configure process](assets/configureProcess.png)

1.  In the `process-1` card, click the advanced settings icon near the top right corner to review the configuration JSON. Add an `env` property to define your environment variables. Use the following format, replacing the placeholders with your own values.
    ```json
      "env": {
        "CAMERA_NAME": "camera-1",
        "VISION_NAME": "people-detector",
        "PIEZO_NAME": "piezo",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY_ID": "your-api-key-id",
        "ROBOT_ADDRESS": "your-robot-address"
      },
    ```
    ![configure JSON](assets/configureProcessJSON.png)
    > aside negative
    >
    > - The `CAMERA_NAME`, `VISION_NAME`, and `PIEZO_NAME` can be found in the Viam app interface.
    > - Other machine credentials are located under the **CONNECT** tab. Select an SDK and toggle **Include API key** to reveal your credentials in the code sample.
        ![get credentials](assets/APIcreds.png)
1.  **Save** and apply your changes.
1.  Test the process by navigating to the **CONTROL** tab. Find the `people-detector` service and observe what happens when a person is detected.
    ![person detected](assets/personDetected.png)
1.  Customize the process by editing the `process.py` file on your Raspberry Pi. For example:

    - Adjust the sensitivity or detect a different object by modifying [this section of the code](https://github.com/loopDelicious/viam-people-detection-process/blob/main/process.py#L42).
    - Update the piezo parameters or use the Harry Potter theme song instead of a single note by modifying [this section of the code](https://github.com/loopDelicious/viam-people-detection-process/blob/main/process.py#L48).

    After making your changes:

    - **Save** your code changes.
    - **Restart** the machine to apply the updates.
      ![restart the machine](assets/restart.png)

      > aside negative
      > **Tip**: You can edit the file on your computer and copy the updated version to your Raspberry Pi using `scp`, as shown earlier. Alternatively, use the default Raspberry Pi OS text editor `nano` by entering the following command from the SSH prompt:

      ```bash
      nano process.py
      ```

### Finishing touches

Now that your system is working the way you want it, it's time to tidy up our project so it's not a loose jumble of wires and parts.

1. **Assemble the enclosure**: 3D print (or buy) an enclosure for your Raspberry Pi. I found [an existing design that I liked](https://makerworld.com/en/models/62316#profileId-226178) to fit a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B that provides access to the GPIO pins. You can modify an existing design to include notches for your piezo buzzer and webcam.
1. **Detector placement**: Set this up near a place you want to monitor. For example, if you want to sound the buzzer when someone is near your desk, point the camera in a direction that will capture your approach.
1. **Train a custom ML model**: Instead of actuating the piezo when any person is detected, train your own ML model to detect when a specific person or pet is detected. You could extend this logic to trigger actuation if a person is detected but not one that is known.
1. **Update the actuation**: Instead of actuating the piezo when an object is detected, integrate a service to send a notification, [generate an insult](https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/roboroast-upload-your-photo-to-get-an-algorithmically-generated-insult/), or [turn on a smart light](https://app.viam.com/module/joyce/kasasmartplug).

## Additional resources and troubleshooting

Duration: 5

### Additional resources

- The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi. When working with Viam, make sure to reference the physical pin numbers, and not the GPIO numbers listed on `pinout.xyz`.
- [ML model service](https://docs.viam.com/services/ml/) | Viam docs
- [Vision service](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision/) | Viam docs
<!-- - The [demo video](https://youtu.be/TZJSAncrU4o?feature=shared) provides a brief overview of the project. -->

### Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance

1. **Security**
   - Do not share your API credentials publicly. Sharing this information could compromise your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your machine, or to the computer running your machine.
1. **Flashing firmware**
   - Make sure you are using a 5V 5A (25W) power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
   - Participants must remember the `hostname` and `username` they set while flashing their Raspberry Pi, as they will need this when they SSH into the Pi.
   - To save time, instructors can flash all the Pis ahead of time with pre-determined credentials and share the credentials with participants during the workshop. Each Pi should have a unique `hostname` to avoid conflicts on the shared local network, such as `&lt;student-name&gt;-detection` or `&lt;group-name&gt;-detection` if they are working in groups.
     - If you're using SD cards, verify that you have a way to write data onto them before providing them to participants.
1. **Working with actuators**
   - **Disabling a resource**: In a group setting, working with piezos can be fun, but also potentially disruptive. Learners can disable the resource by toggling off `process-1`, for example.
     ![disable resource](assets/disable.png)
   - **Alternative actuators**: A buzzer is just one type of actuator, but the possibilities are endless.
     - Use an RGB LED, which functions similarly as a PWM-actuated component
     - Use a smart plug to control a lamp as shown in [this module](https://app.viam.com/module/joyce/kasasmartplug) or [this tutorial](https://www.viam.com/post/object-detection-turn-your-lights-on).
     - Use a [servo motor](https://docs.viam.com/components/servo/) to wave a flag or hit a gong.
1. **Configuring machine and peripherals**
   - If any problems occur while setting up the machine and peripherals in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.
   - Also refer to the overall [Viam troubleshooting guide](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/troubleshooting/).

### Logistics for continued learning

Participants have several options for continuing their projects beyond the workshop environment:

- **Take-home projects**: For participants allowed to take their projects home after the workshop, the `viam-agent` on the Raspberry Pi can simplify the setup process:

  - **Provisioning mode**: Upon rebooting the Raspberry Pi in a new environment like at home, the `viam-agent` automatically creates a Wi-Fi hotspot if it cannot connect to a known network.
  - **Connect to the hotspot**: Look for a network named `viam-setup-HOSTNAME` in your list of available Wi-Fi networks, where `HOSTNAME` is the custom hostname you set during the workshop, and `viamsetup` is the default password. Connect your laptop to this network.
  - **Provide network information for the machine**: Go to the provisioning portal at `http://viam.setup/` in a browser to follow [the on-screen instructions](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/provision/#end-user-experience) to configure the Raspberry Pi for your home Wi-Fi.

- **Remote control**: If participants are not allowed to take their projects home after the workshop, but want to continue working on their projects from home, they can access the Raspberry Pi remotely from anywhere in the world and continue accessing camera data. If participants do not have SSH access into the Raspberry Pi, participants can write and run code on their laptops from home.
