# Plant watering with moisture sensor and pump

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 5

Building a useful robot doesn’t have to require complicated code or expensive equipment. With a Raspberry Pi and some cheap, basic hardware, you can keep your plants healthy and happy from anywhere in the world!

Follow this workshop to learn how to set up an automatic plant watering system by wiring the components of the device, configuring it in the Viam app, and coding a simple script to activate the water pump motor.

### What You'll Build

## Set up your Plant Watering Device

Duration: 10

Before programming the Pi to make the plant watering robot functional, you need to physically set up the plant watering robot by wiring the different components together. You will set up the robot to receive signals from the resistive soil moisture sensor and signal to the pump when it is time to pump water from the water’s container to the plant’s container.

Refer back to this full wiring diagram as you complete the steps to wire your hardware.

![Full Wiring Diagram](assets/DIAGRAM.png)

For wiring the sensor module, follow the below chart (see <https://pinout.xyz/> for a detailed look at the Raspberry Pi pin layout):

- PIN 4 (3V) to VCC (Power)
- PIN 6 (GND) to GND (Ground)
- PIN 40 (DIGITAL OUTPUT) to DO (Digital Output)

For connecting the soil moisture sensor to the sensor module, + goes to +, and - to -.

For wiring the relay, follow the below chart:

- PIN 1 (3.3V) to COM
- PIN 2 (5V) to 5V
- PIN 14 (GND) to GND
- PIN 8 (IN) to IN

Last step in the wiring section is connecting the pump and the water tube:

- NO (Normally Open) to pump motor
- GPIO 39 (GND) to pump motor

Now you are done!

Make sure you understand these concepts before moving ahead.

## Configure your Plant Watering Device

Duration: 5

- Go to your Viam app account and [sign in](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations/).

- Under the **LOCATIONS** tab, create a new machine and follow the setup steps.

- Configure your components, start with the board: selecting `pi` for the Raspberry Pi 4 or `pi5` for the Raspberry Pi 5.

![Board Configuration](assets/board.png)

- Then test your components:

  - In the Control tab, get the state of pin 40. Adjust the moisture sensor sensitivity from the blue screw top notch: This sets a threshold, so that when the soil moisture level exceeds the threshold, the module outputs LOW (0), otherwise HIGH (1). Try reading from your pin while you adjust and put the end of the sensor in water.

  - Then test your relay and pump in the Control tab by setting the state of pin 8 High (1).

## Program your Plant Watering Device

Duration: 10

The full example code is in the [project Github repository](https://github.com/viam-labs/plant-watering-workshop). From there, you can:

- follow the "Getting started" instructions in the README to get the program running in a [GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)
- or set it up in your local development environment
  - In your terminal, [clone the repository to your local development environment](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository): `git clone https://github.com/viam-labs/plant-watering-workshop.git`
  - Change directories into the newly-cloned project: `cd plant-watering-workshop`
  - [Set up a Python virtual environment](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/python/python-venv/) to avoid any conflicts with other projects or your system: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
  - Install [the Viam Python SDK](https://python.viam.dev): `pip install viam-sdk`

Grab the machine address, API Key, and API Key ID from the Connect tab, [Code Sample sub-tab](https://docs.viam.com/cloud/machines/#code-sample) and insert them in the `plantwatering.py` provided. This is how your code connects to your device.

```python
ROBOT_API_KEY = os.getenv('ROBOT_API_KEY') or 'PUT ROBOT API KEY HERE'
ROBOT_API_KEY_ID = os.getenv('ROBOT_API_KEY_ID') or 'PUT ROBOT API KEY ID HERE'
ROBOT_ADDRESS = os.getenv('ROBOT_ADDRESS') or 'PUT ROBOT ADDRESS HERE'
```

In the main loop of the program (a method called `moisture_loop`), you are getting the pin values from the board, if the moisture is detected from the sensor (low pin value), it is setting the relay pin to false and not pump any water. If the moisture is not detected (high pin value), it is setting the relay pin to true and pumping water.

```python
async def moisture_loop(board):
    '''
    moisture_pin value:
    - high: no moisture (True)
    - low: means there is moisture (False)
    '''
    # Main program loop, with relay pin
    moisture_pin = await board.gpio_pin_by_name(MOISTURE_PIN)
    relay_pin = await board.gpio_pin_by_name(RELAY_PIN)
    detect_moisture = await moisture_pin.get()

    # debug
    print(f'moisture_loop: {MOISTURE_PIN}:{detect_moisture}')
    if detect_moisture == True:
        # start the relay
        await relay_pin.set(True)
    else:
        # stop the relay
        await relay_pin.set(False)

    # return the status of the relay
    return await relay_pin.get()
```

The while function in the `main` function, let's you know if the relay is running or not, and allows you to sleep after certain minutes of being on. This will change depending on the size of the pot and how much water you want to pump each cycle.

```python
 while True:
        running = await moisture_loop(pi)
        if running:
            # you can sleep for 5 seconds (depending on size of pot)
            print('relay running')
        else:
            print('relay not running')
        await asyncio.sleep(watering_sleep)
```

Run the program: `python plantwatering.py`

You should see some output to the console about connecting to the robot, along with messages about the relay running or not running depending on the return value of the `moisture_loop`.

## Next Steps

Duration: 1

Now that you have created your automatic plant watering device with a resistive soil moisture sensor, you can easily use Viam to automate other aspects of your garden. For example:

- You run the code as a process on the Raspberry Pi so it can run forever and offline: [Add the control code to your machine](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/environment-variables/index.html?index=..%2F..index#4)
- You can use a [light sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Sensor-Module-Raspberry-Integrated-Circuits/dp/B07L15M5JG) or a [temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.com/KY-011-Cathode-Arduino-Starter-2-color/dp/B07869PKKF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=arduino+two+color+led+module&qid=1556591832&s=gateway&sr=8-2&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=murraynet-20&linkId=c36cd98be29498a9883b656c7011b6bb&language=en_US) to get readings to optimize the plant health.
- You can set up data capture and [graph your sensor data](/tutorials/services/visualize-data-grafana/), or [create your own custom Typescript dashboard](/tutorials/control/air-quality-fleet/) to display your sensor data.
- You can add a camera and [train a machine learning model](https://docs.viam.com/services/ml/train-model/#train-a-model) to track the health of your plant.
