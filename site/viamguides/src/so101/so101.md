## Set up your SO-101 robotic arm

Duration: 5

This section will guide you through the process of setting up the SO-101 arm in Viam, after you have already configured the motors and calibrated the arm.

### Power up your SO-101 arm

1. Ensure your SO-101 robotic arm is properly assembled and all connections are secure.
1. Ensure your arm is anchored securely to a stable surface.
1. Move the arm into a safe position.
   ![SO-101 arm resting position](assets/resting.png)
1. Connect the USB cable to your computer to enable communication with your control system.
   ![SO-101 arm data connection](assets/resting.png)
1. Connect the power supply to your SO-101 arm to turn it on.
   ![SO-101 arm power connection](assets/resting.png)

### Identify serial port

Next, find your serial `port` that you'll need in order to set up the SO-101 to communicate with Viam. If you already have this information from calibrating the arm, you can skip this section.

1. From your terminal, run the following command to list the serial ports on your computer.
   ![list serial ports](assets/listSerial.png)

   **On macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   ls /dev/tty*
   ```

   **On Windows:**

   ```cmd
   mode
   ```

1. To identify the serial port used by your SO-101 arm, look for a device that disappears when you disconnect your SO-101 arm via USB cable, and reappears when you reconnect it. Common names include:

   - macOS: `/dev/tty.usbserial-*` or `/dev/tty.usbmodem*`
   - Linux: `/dev/ttyUSB*` or `/dev/ttyACM*`
   - Windows: `COM*` (e.g., `COM3`, `COM4`)

1. Note down the exact port name. You'll need this for the arm configuration.

### Identify location of the configuration file

Next, find your `calibration_file` that you'll need in order to set up the SO-101 to work smoothly with Viam. The calibration file is typically generated during the final step of the SO-101 setup process using LeRobot.

1. Find the locaion of the calibration JSON file by running the following command.

   **On macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   find ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration -name '*.json'
   ```

   **On Windows:**

   ```cmd
   Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\huggingface\lerobot\calibration" -Recurse -Filter *.json
   ```

1. In the following example, you can see that there are actually 2 calibrated arms. Make a note of the one that you will be setting up in Viam. You'll need it for the arm configuration in Viam.
   ![find calibration files](assets/calibrationFile.png)

   > aside negative
   > The calibration file contains joint limits and motor configurations for your robotic arm. You can use `cat` with the path of your calibration file to further inspect the values.
   > ![cat calibration file](assets/calibrationJson.png)

## Set up your SO-101 control system

Duration: 2

The SO-101 arm is controlled via a USB serial connection, so most Mac, Windows, or Linux machines can be used to follow along with this codelab. The screenshots shown below are using a Macbook.

### Add a new Viam machine

1. In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **LOCATIONS** tab, create a machine by typing in a name and clicking **Add machine**.
   ![add machine](assets/addMachine.png)
1. Once your machine is created, you are brought to your machine overview page. Click **View setup instructions**.
   ![setup instructions](assets/viewSetup.png)
1. Install `viam-server` on the device that you want to use to communicate with and control your robot arm. For example, select the `Mac` platform if you want to use your Mac computer to control the arm. If you're using a different computer, select the platform appropriate for your setup.
   ![select platform](assets/selectPlatform.png)
1. Follow the instructions that are shown for your platform. Copy the command shown and run it in your terminal.
   ![run viam server](assets/runViamServer.png)
1. The setup page will indicate when the machine is successfully connected.
   ![live machine](assets/success.png)

With a machine configured, we now need to configure the SO-101 arm's components next!

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Configure your arm and gripper

Duration: 5

Next, let's configure the SO-101 arm components (arm and gripper) that you'll need in order to teleoperate the arm.

### Configure your SO-101 arm

1. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component or service**.
   ![select component or service](assets/selectComponent.png)
1. Search for the `so101 :arm` module and select it.
   ![find the SO-101 arm component](assets/findArm.png)
1. Add the module, and change the name to something descriptive, like `so101-arm`, then click **Create**. This adds the module for working with the SO-101 arm, particularly its joints.
1. A helpful card about the module is shown. Information such as what the module does, its usage, and supported platforms are all available.
   ![arm module card info](assets/moduleCard.png)
1. Notice adding this module also adds the arm hardware component you named `so101-arm`. You'll see another card on the right, where you can configure the arm component, see any errors originating from the component, and test the component directly, and the corresponding `so101-arm` part listed in the left sidebar.
1. Next, you'll configure the arm with the data you collected earlier. Under the **CONFIGURE** section of the arm component, configure the serial communication by setting the `port` to the correct serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`). Then customize the calibration values by setting the `calibration_file` to the full path of the calibration file.
   ![configure arm component](assets/configureArm.png)
   > aside negative
   > If the path to the `calibration_file` is not provided, the module will use default calibration values. But it's generally recommended to provide this information, for the arm to run much more smoothly.
1. To give the arm a reference to its position and orientation within the machine's spatial environment, we'll need to add a frame. Still within the **CONFIGURE** section of the arm component, click **Add Frame**.
   ![add frame to SO-101 arm](assets/addFrame.png)
1. Notice that this adds a default frame with some default values. Once we apply our configuration updates, these frame values will correspond to the arm representation under the **VISUALIZE** tab.
   ![default frame added to arm](assets/updateFrame.png)
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.
1. When prompted, allow the application to accept incoming network connections. This enables your computer to communicate with the SO-101 arm over a serial connection.
   ![allow network connections](assets/allowPermissions.png)
1. Under the **VISUALIZE** tab, you can see a representation of the arm.
   ![visualize arm](assets/visualizeArm.png)

   > aside negative
   > If any problems occur, check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.

We now have a connection to the arm (and its joints). Last thing to add is the gripper.

### Configure your SO-101 gripper

1. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component or service**.
1. Search for the `so101 :gripper` module and select it.
   ![find the SO-101 gripper component](assets/addGripper.png)
1. Change the name to something descriptive, like `so101-gripper`, then click **Create**. This adds the module for working with the SO-101 gripper, particularly its joints.
1. Notice adding this module adds the gripper hardware component you named `so101-gripper`. You'll see a collapsible card on the right, where you can configure the gripper component, see any errors originating from the component, and test the component directly, and the corresponding `so101-gripper` part listed in the left sidebar.
1. Next, you'll configure the gripper component. You can use the same `port` and `calibration_file` used with the arm component.
   ![added gripper component](assets/configureGripper.png)
1. Next, to give the gripper a reference to its position and orientation within the machine's spatial environment, we'll need to once again add a frame. In the **CONFIGURE** panel (within the gripper component), click **Add Frame** to add a default frame with some default values. For the `parent` key, change the value to the name of your arm, so `so101-arm`:
   ![update parent in frame](assets/parent.png)
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.

   > aside negative
   > Troubleshooting: If you receive connection errors, verify that your serial ports are correctly identified. You can use `ls /dev/tty*` to list available serial devices on your system. Also ensure that your SO-101 arm is powered on and properly connected before attempting to configure it in Viam.

Now that all of your SO-101 arm's components are configured in Viam, it's time to test them out.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Test your arm

Duration: 5

1. Click the **CONTROL** tab. If properly configured, you'll find testing panels for your SO-101 arm, camera, and gripper. You should see a set of Joint Position Movement panels for the arm, a live camera feed for the SO-101's camera, and an Open/Close testing panel for the gripper.
   ![GIF Screen capture of control panel that shows arm, camera, and gripper testing panels](assets/resting.png)

### Test your SO-101 gripper

1. Expand your SO-101 gripper's TEST panel. Here, you can test opening and closing the gripper.
2. Assuming the gripper is in the default open state, test the Grab action by selecting the **Grab** button. To test the open action, select the **Open** button:
   ![GIF of testing SO-101 gripper component](assets/resting.png)

### Test your SO-101 arm

1. Expand your SO-101 arm's TEST panel. Here, you can test the movement of your arm's joints in different ways.
1. To test the movement of specific joints, you can use the `MoveToJointPositions` panel. For example, to move joint 0 (the base joint), change the angle for joint 0's input, then press **Execute**. To test the end effector joint, change the angle for the appropriate joint, then press **Execute**:
   ![GIF of testing SO-101 arm joint movement](assets/resting.png)
1. Try also testing the movement to specific positions using the `MoveToPosition` panel. For example, to move the arm forward and backward (relative to its orientation in the world and known coordinate system), change the `Y` input value, then press **Execute**. To move the arm up, change the `Z` input value to a higher number. To move it back down, change the `Z` input value to a lower number. To test the rotation of the wrist, try changing the `theta`'s input value:
   ![GIF of testing SO-101 arm movement to specific positions](assets/resting.png)

Congratulations! You now have a working SO-101 robotic arm connected to Viam.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Teleoperate your SO-101 arm

Duration: 10

Now that your SO-101 arm is configured and tested, let's set up remote control capabilities to teleoperate it from anywhere.

### Set up remote access

1. Ensure your machine is connected to the internet and accessible from external networks.
2. In the Viam app, verify that your machine shows as "Online" in the machine overview.
   ![machine online status](assets/resting.png)
3. Test remote access by accessing your machine's control panel from a different device or network.

### Configure teleoperation controls

1. In the **CONTROL** tab, you can use the existing testing panels for basic teleoperation.
2. For more advanced control, consider setting up custom control interfaces or using Viam's SDKs to create custom control applications.
   ![custom control interface](assets/resting.png)
3. You can also configure keyboard shortcuts or gamepad controls for more intuitive operation.

### Test remote operation

1. From a remote location, access your Viam machine through the web interface.
2. Test basic arm movements using the control panels.
3. Verify that camera feed is accessible and responsive.
4. Test gripper operations remotely.
