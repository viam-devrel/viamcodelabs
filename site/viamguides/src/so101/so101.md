## Connect the SO-ARM101 to your machine
Duration: 8

The SO-ARM101 communicates with your computer via USB connection. This section will guide you through the proper setup and verification.

### Make the USB Connection

1. **Connect the USB cable**:
   - Use the provided USB cable to connect the SO-ARM101 control board to your computer
   - You should see indicator LEDs on the control board
   ![arm control board connected](./assets/arm_control_connected.jpeg)
1. **Verify USB detection**:
   - Check that the USB device is detected:
     ```bash
     ls /dev/tty*
     ```
   - Look for a device that appears when you connect the arm
   ![list of serial device paths](./assets/list_serial_devices.png)
1. **Check USB serial device**:
   - You should see a device like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, or `/dev/tty.usbmodem58CD1767051` (the part after "usbmodem" is a unique ID for that control board) on MacOS

Note the path to that device on your computer, a.k.a "port". It will be used to configure your machine in the following steps.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Configure calibration sensor
Duration: 5

Now you'll configure the calibration component that the SO-101 module provides.
This is used in tandem with a [Viam App](https://docs.viam.com/operate/control/viam-applications/) to provide convenient workflows for setting up your arm.

### Add the calibration sensor

1. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component or service**.
   ![add component or service](./assets/add_component_service.png)
1. Select `sensor`, and find the `so101:calibration` model. This adds the `so101-arm` module for working with the SO-ARM101. Rename the default name to `calibration`.
   ![add sensor](./assets/add_calibration.png)
   ![name sensor](./assets/name_calibration.png)
1. Notice adding this module adds the sensor hardware component called `calibration`. Add the following JSON object under the **CONFIGURE** section of the new corresponding panel.
    Set the `calibration_file` to something descriptive for your arm, then set the `port` to the USB path connecting your arm to your computer.
   ```json
   {
     "calibration_file": "so101_follower.json",
     "port": "/dev/tty.usbmodem58CD1767051"
   }
   ```
   ![configure sensor](./assets/configure_calibration.png)
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.

### Connect to the setup app

1. Open [https://so101-setup_devrel.viamapplications.com/](https://so101-setup_devrel.viamapplications.com/) in a new browser tab.
1. Authenticate using your Viam login details.
   ![Viam auth login](./assets/setup_app_auth.png)
1. Select your organization, location, and machine from the relevant dropdown. This will allow the setup app to connect to viam-server running on your machine.
   ![select Viam machine](./assets/setup_app_select_machine.png)

> Troubleshooting: If you get a 404 message after selecting your machine, please add a trailing slash `/` to the end of the URL, i.e. `https://so101-setup_devrel.viamapplications.com/machine/so101-main.kw8sl6xdac.viam.cloud` would become `https://so101-setup_devrel.viamapplications.com/machine/so101-main.kw8sl6xdac.viam.cloud/`.

Next up, you'll use this app to set up the motors and calibrate the joints of the arm.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Assign IDs to motors
Duration: 10

Now you'll assign the expected ID to each motor of the robot arm.
If you've already completed this task when assembling the arm, skip ahead to the next step of calibration.

### Walk through motor assignment

1. Select "Motor Setup Only" from the list of workflows.
1. Review the workspace requirements and safety requirements, then select "Begin Setup Process ->".
   ![workflow overview step](./assets/setup_app_workflow_overview.png)
1. Review the step by step instructions on the page, connect the gripper motor to the control board and select "Discover Motor" to find the current ID of the motor (may differ from the screenshot).
   ![discover motor ID](./assets/setup_app_motor_discover.png)
1. Select "Configure Motor" to set the target ID of the motor.

## Configure your so101 arm
Duration: 10

### Configure the arm component
1. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component or service**.
   ![add component or service](./assets/add_component_service.png)
1. Search for the `so101:arm` module and select it. 
    <img alt="find the so101 arm component" src="./assets/search_arm_component.png" width=400 />
1. Change the name to something descriptive, like `follower-arm`, then click **Create**. This adds the component for working with the first five joints of the robot.
  <img alt="add the so101 arm component" src="./assets/name_arm_component.png" width=400 />
1. Notice adding this module adds the arm hardware component called `follower-arm`. You'll see a collapsible card on the right, where you can configure the arm component, see any errors originating from the component, and test the component directly, and the corresponding `follower-arm` part listed in the left sidebar. 
   Copy the configuration from the calibration sensor and paste it into the configuration area for the arm component.
   ```json
   {
     "calibration_file": "so101_follower.json",
     "port": "/dev/tty.usbmodem58CD1767051"
   }
   ```
   ![added arm component](./assets/configure_arm_component.png)
1. Delete the calibration sensor component to prevent conflicts with using the arm component at the same port.
   ![remove calibration sensor](./assets/remove_calibration.png)
1. To give the arm a reference to its position and orientation within the machine's spatial environment, we'll need to add a frame. Within the Configure panel within the arm component, click **Add Frame**.
   <img alt="add frame to dofbot arm" src="./assets/configure_arm_frame.png" />
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.

We now have a connection to the arm (and its joints). Last thing to add is the gripper.

### Configure the gripper component
1. Click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Component or service**.
1. Search for the `so101:gripper` module and select it. 
  <img alt="find the so101 gripper component" src="./assets/search_gripper_component.png" width=400 />
1. Change the name to something descriptive, like `follower-gripper`, then click **Create**. This adds the module for working with the last joint of the arm, which controls the gripper.
  <br>
  <img alt="add the so101 gripper component" src="./assets/name_gripper_component.png" width=350 />
1. Notice adding this module adds the gripper hardware component called `follower-gripper`. You'll see a collapsible card on the right, where you can configure the gripper component, see any errors originating from the component, and test the component directly, and the corresponding `follower-gripper` part listed in the left sidebar. 
   Copy the configuration from the arm component and paste it into the configuration area for the gripper.
   ```json
   {
     "calibration_file": "so101_follower.json",
     "port": "/dev/tty.usbmodem58CD1767051"
   }
   ```
  <img alt="added gripper component" src="./assets/configure_gripper_component.png" />
1. To give the gripper a reference to its position and orientation within the machine's spatial environment, we'll need to add a frame. In the Configure panel (within the gripper component), click **Add Frame**.
   For the `parent` key, change the value to the name of your arm, so `follower-arm`:
  <img alt="add frame to so101 gripper" src="./assets/configure_gripper_frame.png" />
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.

Now that all of your arm's components are configured in Viam, it's time to test them out.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Test your arm
Duration: 5

1. Click the **CONTROL** tab. If properly configured, you'll find testing panels for your arm and gripper. You should see a set of Joint Position Movement panels for the arm, and an Open/Close testing panel for the gripper.

### Test the arm component
1. Expand the arm's TEST panel. Here, you can test the movement of your arm's joints in different ways.
   ![test arm component](./assets/test_arm_component.png)
1. To test the movement of specific joints,  you can use the `MoveToJointPositions` panel. For example, to move joint 0 (the lowest on the arm), change the angle for joint 0's input, the press **Execute**. To test the top-most joint (in our case, where the gripper is mounted), change the angle for joint 4, then press **Execute**:
   ![GIF of testing arm joint movement](./assets/control_joints.gif)
1. Try also testing the movement to specific positions using the `MoveToPosition` panel. For example, to move the arm forward and backward (relative to its orientation in the world and known coordinate system), change the `Y` input value, then press **Execute**. To move the arm up, change the `Z` input value to a higher number. To move it back down, change the `Z` input value to a lower number. To test the rotation of the wrist, try changing the `θ`'s input value:
   ![GIF of testing arm movement to specific positions](./assets/control_position.gif)

### Test the gripper component
1. Expand the gripper's TEST panel. Here, you can test opening and closing the gripper.
   ![test gripper component](./assets/test_gripper_component.png)
3. Assuming the gripper is in the default open state, test the Grab action by selecting the **Grab** button. To test the open action, select the **Open** button:
   ![GIF of testing gripper](./assets/control_gripper.gif)
