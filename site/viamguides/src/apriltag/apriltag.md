# Use an AprilTag scanner

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 2

**Why would you want to detect AprilTags?** [AprilTags](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag), similar to QR codes, can encode a variety of information and are widely used in robotics and computer vision applications. Unlike QR codes, AprilTags are designed for scenarios where precise localization, identification, and orientation are critical. They are commonly used for tasks such as guiding autonomous vehicles, tracking objects, and enhancing augmented reality systems.

In this codelab, you'll learn how to detect and decode AprilTags using a Viam module. We'll leverage the [`apriltag`](https://pypi.org/project/apriltag/) and [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) Python libraries to process images from a camera and extract information encoded in AprilTags. By the end, you'll have a working solution that can identify AprilTags in real-time, enabling customizable actions for a variety of applications, from navigation to interactive robotics.

## Set up your Raspberry Pi

Duration: 6

The Raspberry Pi boots from a USB flash drive (or microSD card). You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on a USB flash drive that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the USB flash drive (or microSD card) to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.png)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the USB flash drive you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.png)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `test`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.

   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on the USB flash drive. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to the USB flash drive.
1. Remove the USB flash drive from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the USB flash drive into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
   > aside negative
   > Make sure you are using a 5V 3A USB-C power supply to power your Raspberry Pi 4. Using a power supply with inadequate amperage can lead to instability, throttling, or unexpected behavior. Additionally, while USB boot is enabled by default on newer Raspberry Pi 4 models, older versions may require a firmware update to enable it. Refer to the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html) for detailed setup instructions and compatibility.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
   ```bash
   ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
   ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
