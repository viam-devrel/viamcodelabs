Duration: 30

### Set up your air monitoring device

The PMS7003 particulate sensor measures the air quality and transmits data in a [serial stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) from the transmitter pin (TX) to the receiver pin (RX pin) on the Raspberry Pi.

![photo of PMS7003 connected to Raspberry Pi](assets/sensorWPi.jpg)

> aside positive
> The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi.

Refer to the following wiring diagram to connect the Raspberry Pi to the PMS7003 air monitoring device.

![wiring diagram](assets/wiring.png)

- Pin 4 (3V) to VCC (Power)
- Pin 6 (GND) to GND (Ground)
- Pin 8 (TX) to RX (receiver)
- Pin 10 (RX) to TX (transmitter)

To power the Raspberry Pi, you can use the USB cord from earlier to continue providing power from your computer, or use a separate USB power supply.

### Set up your air filter

Make your own air purifier by combining a box fan and air filter to effectively clean the air in a small to medium sized, closed room.

1. Attach the filter to the back of the fan, ensuring the airflow arrow points toward the fan. The fan should **pull air through the filter** when operating. If the filter will block access to the fan's power knob, now is a good time to switch it to an `on` position.
1. Secure the filter using [3D-printed clips](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:968923) or duct tape. Write the date when the filter is first used directly on the filter.
   ![box fan and air filter](assets/boxFanClips.jpg)

### Set up your smart plug

1. Plug your Kasa smart plug into a power outlet.
1. Set up your smart plug and connect it to your local Wifi [using the Kasa mobile app](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/946/) from the App Store or Google Play.
1. From the command line of your terminal app, install the [`python-kasa`](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library, and enter the command `kasa discover` to locate the IP address of the connected device. Make a note of the IP address since we'll need it again soon.
   > aside negative
   > If you have access to your router's admin page, you can also find your smart plug's IP address from a web browser. From a web browser, enter your router's IP address (commonly `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`) and log in using your admin username and password. Look for a section like "Connected Devices," "Device List," or "DHCP Clients." Locate your Kasa smart plug by its name, MAC address (shown in the Kasa mobile app), or manufacturer name (usually TP-Link).
1. Plug the box fan into the Kasa smart plug. Toggle the box fan power with the Kasa app to make sure it's working as expected.
   ![photo of Kasa smart plug with fan](assets/smartPlug.jpg)

### Set up your Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi boots from a USB flash drive (or microSD card). You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on a USB flash drive that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the USB flash drive (or microSD card) to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.png)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 5.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the USB flash drive you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.png)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `air`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
   ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/generalSettings.png)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
   ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/sshSettings.png)
   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on the USB flash drive. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to the USB flash drive.
1. Remove the USB flash drive from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the USB flash drive into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.

  <input type="radio" value="By automatically updating hardware firmware during testing.">
</form>

### Program your air monitoring device

At this point, you have configured and tested your machine and peripherals, but nothing is happening automatically. In the next section, program your air monitoring device to be a little smarter. Make your machine periodically get readings, turn on the air filter if the values are high, and turn off again when the values are low.

![process diagram](assets/diagram.png)

### Create an automation script

1. To configure the machine to automatically run a command to execute a script, use a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/). Create a new file on your computer called `process.py`.

   On MacOS, Linux, or Windows WSL:

   ```bash
   touch process.py
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```cmd
   type nul > process.py
   ```

1. Copy and paste [this sample code](https://github.com/loopDelicious/viam-pm25-process/blob/main/process.py) into the new file `process.py`. This code will allow your Raspberry Pi to connect to both our sensor and plug and execute our logic.
1. Now it's time to move your control code to your Raspberry Pi device. [SSH into your Raspberry Pi](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#connect-with-ssh) if you're not already SSH'd.
1. From the SSH prompt on your Raspberry Pi, install the Python package manager.

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
   ```

1. Install the Viam Python SDK into a new directory called `process`.
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install --target=process viam-sdk
   ```
1. Display the full path of the current directory you are working in on your Raspberry Pi with the `pwd` command. Make a note of this output for the next steps.
   ```bash
   $ pwd
   ```
1. Find the executable path of Python3 to run `process.py` on your Raspberry Pi with `which python3`. Again, make a note of this output for the next steps.
   ```bash
   $ which python3
   ```
1. Run the following command from your computer (not the SSH prompt to your Raspberry Pi) to copy the code from your computer to your Raspberry Pi. In the command, you will copy `process.py` over to your Raspberry Pi, with the section following the colon `:` indicating where your file should be copied to on the Raspberry Pi (the path of the directory you are working in on your Raspberry Pi, along with the filename).
   ```bash
   $ scp process.py user@host.local:/home/myboard/process/process.py
   ```

<form>
  <name>What is the primary role of the `process.py` script in the air monitoring system?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="To display air quality readings directly on the Raspberry Pi.">
  <input type="radio" value="To define the logic for periodically checking sensor readings and toggling the smart plug based on thresholds.">
  <input type="radio" value="To update the firmware of the air sensor and smart plug.">
  <input type="radio" value="To configure the network settings for the Raspberry Pi.">
</form>

### Configure a Viam process

1.  Now let's allow `viam-server` to run the process as the root user on your Raspberry Pi by configuring a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/). In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **CONFIGURE** tab, click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Process**.
1.  Find the corresponding card to `process-1`. Enter the executable path of Python3 running on your Raspberry Pi that you output from a previous step. Add an argument of the `process.py` file to run on your Raspberry Pi. Enter the working directory where you want the process to execute.
    ![configure process](assets/configureProcess.png)
1.  Still within the `process-1` card, select the advanced settings icon near the top right corner to review the configuration JSON. Create a new `env` property, and add your environment variables within the new property, formatted like the following with your own credentials.
    ```json
      "env": {
        "SENSOR_NAME": "sensor-1",
        "PLUG_NAME": "generic-1",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY_ID": "your-api-key-id",
        "ROBOT_ADDRESS": "your-robot-address"
      },
    ```
    ![configure JSON](assets/configJSON.png)
    > aside negative
    > The `SENSOR_NAME` and `PLUG_NAME` are the default names for our air sensor and smart plug when added to our Viam machine. Other machine credentials can be found under the **CONNECT** tab, selecting an SDK, and toggling **Include API key** to reveal your credentials within the code sample.
        ![get credentials](assets/apiKey.png)
1.  **Save** your updates.
1.  You can test the code by updating the `process.py` file on your Raspberry Pi to update the `do_command` when thresholds are low from `toggle_off` to `toggle_on`. **Save** your code changes, and **Restart** the machine to see if the fan turns on when the air quality is healthy.
    ![restart the machine](assets/restart.png)
    > aside negative
    > You can either edit the file on your computer and copy the updated file over to your Raspberry Pi using `scp` like we did previously. Or you can use the default command-line text editor on Raspberry Pi OS `nano` by entering `nano process.py` from the SSH prompt.
    > ![edit in Nano](assets/nano.png)
    > Alternatively, you can blow on the air sensor until the values rise above the threshold.

### Finishing touches

Now that your system is working the way you want it, it's time to tidy up our project so it's not a loose jumble of wires and parts.

1. 3D print (or buy) an enclosure for your Raspberry Pi and sensor. I found [an existing design that I liked](https://www.printables.com/model/742926-raspberry-pi-5-case) to fit a standard Raspberry Pi 5. Using a piece of heavy-duty velcro, I mounted the sensor on top to ensure the sensor could accurately measure the surrounding air.
   ![photo of Pi and sensor enclosure](assets/device1.jpg)
1. You might prefer to have the Raspberry Pi and air sensor within the same case. If you're planning to design your own enclosure, make sure the air sensor receives adequate ventilation and isn't placed too close to the Raspberry Pi chip, as it can get a bit hot.

## Additional resources and troubleshooting

Duration: 5

### Additional resources

- The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi. When working with Viam, make sure to reference the physical pin numbers, and not the GPIO numbers listed on `pinout.xyz`.
- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides [basics on particulate matter (PM)](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics). For measuring the [indoor air quality](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-pollutants-and-sources) in your home, we'll be looking at PM2.5, a very small particle size.
- The [demo video](https://youtu.be/TZJSAncrU4o?feature=shared) provides a brief overview of the project.

### Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance

1. **Security**
   - Do not share your API credentials publicly. Sharing this information could compromise your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your machine, or to the computer running your machine.
1. **Flashing firmware**
   - Make sure you are using a 5V 5A (25W) power supply. USB boot is disabled by default [when connected to a 3A power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#differences-on-raspberry-pi-5), so adequate amperage is required for the optimal performance of your Raspberry Pi 5.
   - Participants must remember the `hostname` and `username` they set while flashing their Raspberry Pi, as they will need this when they SSH into the Pi.
   - To save time, instructors can flash all the Pis ahead of time with pre-determined credentials and share the credentials with participants during the workshop. Each Pi should have a unique `hostname` to avoid conflicts on the shared local network, such as `&lt;student-name&gt;-air` or `&lt;group-name&gt;-air` if they are working in groups.
     - If you're using SD cards, verify that you have a way to write data onto them before providing them to participants.
1. **Locating IP address of smart plug**
   - In a group setting, configure one smart plug at a time in order to avoid confusion and conflicts in identifying the proper IP addresses on the local area network.
   - If you have access to your router's admin page, you can also find your smart plug's IP address from a web browser. From a web browser, enter your router's IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) and log in using your admin username and password. Look for a section like "Connected Devices," "Device List," or "DHCP Clients." Locate your Kasa smart plug by its name, MAC address (shown in the Kasa mobile app), or manufacturer name (usually TP-Link).
1. **Configuring machine and peripherals**
   - If any problems occur while setting up the machine and peripherals in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.
   - Also refer to the overall [Viam troubleshooting guide](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/troubleshooting/).

### Logistics for continued learning

Participants have several options for continuing their projects beyond the workshop environment:

- **Take-home projects**: For participants allowed to take their projects home after the workshop, the `viam-agent` on the Raspberry Pi can simplify the setup process:

  - **Provisioning mode**: Upon rebooting the Raspberry Pi in a new environment like at home, the `viam-agent` automatically creates a Wi-Fi hotspot if it cannot connect to a known network.
  - **Connect to the hotspot**: Look for a network named `viam-setup-HOSTNAME` in your list of available Wi-Fi networks, where `HOSTNAME` is the custom hostname you set during the workshop, and `viamsetup` is the default password. Connect your laptop to this network.
  - **Provide network information for the machine**: Go to the provisioning portal at `http://viam.setup/` in a browser to follow [the on-screen instructions](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/provision/#end-user-experience) to configure the Raspberry Pi for your home Wi-Fi.

- **Remote control**: If participants are not allowed to take their projects home after the workshop, but want to continue working on their projects from home, they can access the Raspberry Pi remotely from anywhere in the world and continue accessing sensor data. If participants do not have SSH access into the Raspberry Pi, participants can write and run code on their laptops from home.
