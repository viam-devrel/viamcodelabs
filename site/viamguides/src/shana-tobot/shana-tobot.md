1. Click **View setup instructions**.
   ![setup instructions](assets/awaitSetup.png)
1. Install `viam-server` on the device that you want to use to communicate with and control your robot arm. For example, select the `Mac` platform if you want to use your Mac computer to control the arm. If you're using a different computer, select the platform appropriate for your setup.
   ![select platform](assets/selectPlatform.png)
1. Following the rest of the installation instructions on the setup page, install `viam-server` on your computer by entering the provided CLI command into your terminal prompt. The example shown here is on a Mac.
   ![install viam-server](assets/install.png)
1. Download the machine cloud credentials file to your computer for `viam-server` to connect to `app.viam.com`.
1. Run `viam-server` locally on your computer with the config you just downloaded. If your download in the previous step went to a different folder, modify the file path.
   ```bash
   viam-server -config ~/Downloads/viam-shana-tobot-main.json
   ```
1. The setup page will indicate when the machine is successfully connected.

## Configure your machine

Duration: 2

### Configure your machine

Now that our machine is live, let's [configure an arm component](https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/services/accessing-and-moving-robot-arm/).

1. Under the **CONFIGURE** tab for your live machine, click on the **+** symbol next to your machine in the left sidebar and select **Component** in the menu that opens.
   ![add component](assets/component.png)
1. Choose arm as the type, and then choose your desired model. For example, if you’re using a UR5e, choose the `ur5e` model from the list.
   ![select arm model](assets/selectArm.png)
1. Leave the default name, and then click **Create**.
   ![leave arm name](assets/armName.png)
1. In the newly created component panel, configure any attributes as needed. Refer to the documentation for the model for information about your arm’s model. In the example shown here, we are using a `ur5e` arm model, inputting a required `host` field with the arm's IP address, and moving at a speed of `20` degrees per second.
   ![configure attributes](assets/config.png)
1. **Save** your machine's configuration.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Control your machine

Duration: 5

> aside negative
> **⚠️ Caution**: Be careful when instructing robot arms to move. Before running any code, ensure your robotic arm has enough space and that there are no obstacles. Also pay attention to your surroundings, double-check your code for correctness, and make sure anyone nearby is aware and alert before issuing commands to your machine.

### Control your machine from the Viam app

1. Under the **CONTROL** tab of your live machine, find the corresponding panel for your configured arm.
   ![control with Viam app](assets/viamApp.png)
1. Experiment with getting joint positions to fetch data about the robotic arm’s current position, and moving joint positions.

### Control your machine with code

Now that you know how to work with your robotic arm using the Viam app, learn how to program your arm using code.

1. Under the **CONNECT** tab of your live machine, select the Python SDK we'll use to access the arm. Follow the instructions to install the Python SDK if you haven't already.
   ```python
   mkdir shana-tobot && cd shana-tobot
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip3 install viam-sdk
   ```
1. Toggle on `Include API key` to see your machine credentials in the boilerplate code below. Make a note of your `API-KEY`, `API-KEY-ID`, and `MACHINE-ADDRESS-URI` for the next steps.
   ![show API key](assets/connectCode.png)
1. From the command line of your terminal window, create a new file to contain your script.
   ```bash
   touch script.py
   ```
1. To program the movement of the robotic arm, copy and paste the following Python code into `script.py` using your preferred code editor. Be sure to replace the placeholders for `&lt;API-KEY&gt;`, `&lt;API-KEY-ID&gt;`, and `&lt;MACHINE-ADDRESS-URI&gt;` with your own machine credentials from the previous steps.

   > The end position in the code below is hard coded according to the arm in relation to the bowl of honey. To determine the end position to suit your scenario, you can move the arm using the Viam app to the ideal position and then run a new script to log the [`arm.get_end_position()`](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/apis/components/arm/#getendposition) return values to the terminal output. Once the ideal end position is known, you can update the values in the script below.

   ```python
   import asyncio

   from viam.robot.client import RobotClient
   from viam.components.arm import Arm
   from viam.proto.component.arm import JointPositions
   from viam.proto.common import Pose

   async def connect():
     opts = RobotClient.Options.with_api_key(
         api_key='<API-KEY>',
         api_key_id='<API-KEY-ID>'
     )
     return await RobotClient.at_address('<MACHINE-ADDRESS-URI>', opts)

   async def main():
     machine = await connect()

     print('Resources:')
     print(machine.resource_names)

     # move arm to exact end position then get coordinates:
     # arm
     arm = Arm.from_robot(machine, "arm-1")
     arm_return_value = await arm.get_end_position()
     print(f"arm get_end_position return value: {arm_return_value}")

     # hard coded end position - grabbed from terminal output
     x = -117.89177530820058
     y = 810.53648219876914
     z = -86.077008874770044
     o_x = -0.15705296827522847
     o_y = 0.24567021047557136
     o_z = -0.95654613732994043

     cmd_arm_pose = Pose(x=x, y=y, z=z, o_x=o_x, o_y=o_y, o_z=o_z)

     #Move to bowl
     await arm.move_to_position(pose=cmd_arm_pose)

     #adjust to go a little deeper into the honey
     my_arm_joint_positions = await arm.get_joint_positions()
    newJointPos = JointPositions(
        values=[
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[0],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[1] + 6,
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[2],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[3],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[4],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[5],
        ]
    )
     print("dipped")

     await asyncio.sleep(2)

     #what are current joints?
     my_arm_joint_positions = await arm.get_joint_positions()
     print(f"myArm get_joint_positions return value: {my_arm_joint_positions}")

     #lift joint 1 and joint 3, drop joint 2
    newJointPos = JointPositions(
        values=[
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[0],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[1] - 40,
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[2] + 25,
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[3] - 30,
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[4],
            my_arm_joint_positions.values[5],
        ]
    )

     #move
     await arm.move_to_joint_positions(positions=newJointPos)
     print("lifted")

     # Don't forget to close the machine when you're done!
     await machine.close()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
     asyncio.run(main())
   ```

   > It is recommended that you add your API key and API key ID as environment variables and import the variables into your development environment as needed. Check out this step-by-step codelab for [how to work with Python environment variables](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/environment-variables/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0).

1. Save your changes, and then run the script from your command line.
   ```bash
   python3 script.py
   ```

### Customize the robotic arm

In addition to continuing to refine the code, you can also refine the robotic arm. In our example, to dip a sliced apple in a bowl of honey, it was helpful to repurpose the gripper by adding a skewer (in this case a chopstick). For your own use case, a different utensil with different properties and form might be more helpful.
