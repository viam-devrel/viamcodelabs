- **Q&A/Wrap-Up** (10 mins)

### Pre-workshop checklist ✅

Review these setup steps as you're planning the workshop to help prepare for it.

1. **Planning and Logistics**
   - **Verify equipment inventory:** Decide which materials are provided or required for participants to bring on their own. Order any materials and supplies that are provided to participants.
   - **Determine rover allocation for individuals, groups, or virtual access**: Determine whether rovers are provided for each participant, group of participant, or accessed virtually through [Viam's Try Viam](https://www.viam.com/resources/try-viam) experience or at another external location.
   - **Confirm workstation setup**: Verify the workshop room layout supports hardware work, such as tables, and space to drive the rovers. Ensure participants have power outlets and internet access. Have spare supplies, such as Raspberry Pis, adapters/readers, and cables, in case of failures. For virtual workshops, confirm logistics for breakout sessions, providing support, and checkpoints.
   - **Communicate prerequisites**: Share a participant guide prior to the workshop with learning objectives and instructions for installing software and preparing laptops. Provide a checklist for participants to confirm readiness.
   - **Establish support channels**: Determine how participants can get support for real-time troubleshooting (e.g. Slack or Discord channel for virtual workshops, additional helpers in the room for on-site workshops)
   - **Request Viam stickers**: Don't forget [to request Viam stickers](https://forms.gle/TFXBm7L9n8U4hLRj9) for the workshop.
1. **Content Preparation**
   - **Prepare workshop teaching materials**: Review the Delivery Plan, sample slide deck, and provided resources. Tailor these materials to suit your participants' needs. Decide whether to present them to the group or provide them for independent reference, such as through a web browser or printed handouts.
   - **Determine extensibility**: During the Hands-on Experiment portion of the delivery plan, there are many options to guide the workshop on a different learning path. Determine if this section will be self-guided exploration, a group exercise, or self-paced learning for participants to explore on their own after the workshop.
   - **Prepare code and documentation**: Review the provided code and add comments as necessary.
   - **Review discussion topics**: Review the suggested group discussion topics and adjust for your participants.
   - **Review quiz questions**: Review the suggested quiz questions and adjust for your participants. Determine if knowledge assessment will be completed throughout the workshop or afterwards.
1. **Dry Run and Testing**
   - **Test the workshop project**: Run through the build following the prepared documentation to ensure it works as expected. Simulate common issues and prepare troubleshooting tips for these scenarios. If physical space is limited, consider sharing a rover or setting up the rover in a remote location to be viewed through a webcam.
   - **Bring backups**: In addition to the backup supplies mentioned earlier during planning, make sure batteries are charged.

## Delivery Plan - Hands-on Experiment

Duration: 40

### Control your rover with TypeScript

Now that you know how to manually control the rover using the Viam app, let's control the rover programmatically with code using one of [Viam's SDKs](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/). You can run control code from anywhere; it does not necessarily have to be run on the same machine that runs `viam-server`.

1. From the command line within your terminal window of your laptop (not SSH'd into your Pi), let's use a command line utility to quickly set up a new TypeScript project. Input the following command:
   ```bash
   $ npm create robot-app
   ```
1. At the command-line prompt, input your project name. Or hit **Enter** to accept the default project name, `my-viam-project`.
   ![command line prompt](assets/myViamProject.png)
1. Select the project template `controlRover`, and hit **Enter**.
1. Once the project setup is completed, follow the command-line instructions. Navigate into your new project directory. In the example shown below, we are using the default project name `my-viam-project`.
   ```bash
   $ cd my-viam-project
   ```
1. In the Viam app, find the **CONNECT** page, select the **TypeScript** SDK, and turn on **Include API key** to reveal your machine credentials within the code sample. Use these machine credentials to update the `.env` file in your new project directory, and save your changes.
   ![machine credentials](assets/viamMachineCredentials.png)
1. Start the application server. Your web app should be running at `http://localhost:5173/`
   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```
1. Open your browser's devtools, for example, by right-clicking and selecting **Inspect**, to see the browser's console logs. Make sure there is adequate space surrounding your rover. And then press the **Click me** button in the web application to see what happens to your rover.
   ![drive it](assets/driveIt.png)

<form>
  <name>What is the purpose of the `.env` file in your TypeScript project?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="To store the TypeScript code for controlling the rover.">
  <input type="radio" value="To define the credentials needed to connect to your rover.">
  <input type="radio" value="To specify the name of the TypeScript project.">
  <input type="radio" value="To configure the application server's URL.">
</form>

### Customize your TypeScript web application

> aside negative
> **Note for the workshop instructor**: This part of the workshop can be a group exericse, self-guided breakout session, or self-paced learning after the workshop. Ideas for exploration are listed below. And additional ideas for next-level projects are listed on the <a href="./index.html#8" target="_self">**Post-Workshop Resources page**</a>.

Now it's time to customize the TypeScript web application and make it your own. In your preferred IDE, consider the following suggestions for adding more functionality to your web application:

- **Program the business logic**: Edit `src/main.ts` to change the logic being run.
  - Consider moving the rover along a different route using the [Viam `base` API](https://docs.viam.com/components/base/#api), for example, `spin` the rover.
  - Use the [Viam `SLAM` service](https://docs.viam.com/services/slam/) for mapping or the [Viam Navigation service](https://docs.viam.com/services/navigation/) for GPS
  - Integrate with third-party cloud services and APIs to enhance the functionality of your robot, such as voice control, data logging, or GPS tracking.
- **Program the frontend**: Edit `index.html` to change the layout of the web application.
  - Add descriptive text to display each action directly on the webpage, instead of logging it to the console.
  - Display a camera feed within your web application using the [Viam `camera` API](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#api)

<form>
  <name>What is the primary role of `viam-server` in the system architecture of your rover setup?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="It acts as the operating system for the Raspberry Pi.">
  <input type="radio" value="It provides a layer for managing hardware components and enables remote communication via the Viam app or TypeScript app.">
  <input type="radio" value="It processes video and motion data locally without connecting to the cloud.">
  <input type="radio" value="It directly powers the Raspberry Pi.">
</form>

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Additional resources and troubleshooting

Duration: 5

### Additional resources

- The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi. When working with Viam, make sure to reference the physical pin numbers, and not the GPIO numbers listed on `pinout.xyz`.
- The [demo video](https://youtu.be/daU5iNsSO0w?feature=shared) provides a brief overview of the project.
- Viam APIs provide consistent methods of working with components, such as a [`base`](https://docs.viam.com/components/base/#api), [`camera`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#api), and services, such as [`computer vision`](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision/#api). Refer to the [Viam documentation](https://docs.viam.com/platform/) for API reference for all components and services.
- Besides TypeScript, Viam provides [SDKs in various programming languages](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/) to write control code for the backend, frontend, and mobile applications.

<img src="assets/service.png" alt="service icon" width="200">

### Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance

1. **Safety**
   - Lithium-ion batteries may pose a flammable hazard. This product requires four 18650 lithium-ion batteries OR an RC-type battery. DO NOT connect multiple power sources simultaneously. Refer to the battery manufacturer’s operating instructions to ensure safe operation of the Viam Rover. Dispose of lithium-ion batteries per manufacturer instructions.
   - Pay attention to the orientation of the ribbon cable while connecting the Raspberry Pi to the rover, as it can damage the Pi if connected incorrectly.
1. **Security**
   - Do not share your API credentials publicly. Sharing this information could compromise your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your machine, or to the computer running your machine.
1. **Flashing firmware**
   - Make sure you are using a 5V 5A (25W) power supply.
   - Participants must remember the `hostname` and `username` they set while flashing their Raspberry Pi, as they will need this when they SSH into the Pi.
   - To save time, instructors can flash all the Pis ahead of time with pre-determined credentials and share the credentials with participants during the workshop. Each Pi should have a unique `hostname` to avoid conflicts on the shared local network, such as `&lt;student-name&gt;-rover` or `&lt;group-name&gt;-rover` if they are working in groups.
     - If you're using SD cards, verify that you have a way to write data onto them before providing them to participants.
1. **Alternative setups**
   - If you're not using a Raspberry Pi 4, you can use [different boards](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial/#motherboard) with your Viam Rover 2 with some [alternative board configurations](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial/#alternative-board-configurations) while attaching the boards.
   - If you're not using a [Viam rover](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/try-viam/rover-resources/), you can use other wheeled-base robots, like [SCUTTLE and Yahboom](https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/configure/configure-rover/)
1. **Configuring machine and peripherals**
   - If any problems occur while setting up the machine and peripherals in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.
   - Check that all wires are securely attached to the correct pins.
   - If you are using a battery to power the base, check that it is adequately charged. If the motors are drawing more power than the battery can supply, the single-board computer may be power cycling. Consider using a wall power supply for testing purposes to rule out this issue.
   - If you are using a battery to power the base, ensure that the batteries are making contact with the terminals inside the battery pack. Some shorter batteries might need to be pushed along to ensure that contact is being made.
   - Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the base there.
   - Also refer to the overall [Viam troubleshooting guide](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/troubleshooting/).

<img src="assets/viam-rasp.png" alt="raspberry pi icon" width="200">

### Logistics for continued learning

Participants have several options for continuing their projects beyond the workshop environment:

- **Take-home projects**: For participants allowed to take their rover home after the workshop, the `viam-agent` on the Raspberry Pi can simplify the setup process:

  - **Provisioning mode**: Upon rebooting the Raspberry Pi in a new environment like at home, the `viam-agent` automatically creates a Wi-Fi hotspot if it cannot connect to a known network.
  - **Connect to the hotspot**: Look for a network named `viam-setup-HOSTNAME` in your list of available Wi-Fi networks, where `HOSTNAME` is the custom hostname you set during the workshop, and `viamsetup` is the default password. Connect your laptop to this network.
  - **Provide network information for the machine**: Go to the provisioning portal at `http://viam.setup/` in a browser to follow [the on-screen instructions](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/provision/#end-user-experience) to configure the Raspberry Pi for your home Wi-Fi.

- **Remote control**: If participants cannot take their rover home but want to continue their projects, they can access their rover remotely:

  - **Access the workshop rover**: Participants can control the workshop rover remotely from anywhere in the world. A webcam can be set up for participants to view the rover’s movements in real time.
  - **Code from home**: Without SSH access to the Raspberry Pi, participants can still write and test code on their laptops and integrate changes during their next in-person session or via workshop-provided tools.

- **Try Viam virtual experience**: For participants without access to a physical rover, Viam provides an online learning experience called [Try Viam](https://app.viam.com/try) in the web browser to remotely control a rover pre-configured with components in the NYC Viam robotics lab.

### Next-level projects

Here are some ideas for expanding and enhancing the current project to create autonomous behaviors.

- [Detect color with a webcam](https://docs.viam.com/how-tos/detect-color/) guide: to add this capability to your rover to respond to the environment
- [Navigate with a rover base](https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/services/navigate-with-rover-base/) tutorial: to set up user-defined waypoints for your rover to move to in the order that you specify or dynamically adapt using inputs like GPS or vision
- [Train a custom ML model](https://docs.viam.com/how-tos/train-deploy-ml/) guide: to enable object detection or classification and program the rover to act accordingly, such as moving toward or avoiding detected objects
- [Add sensors and other components](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/try-viam/rover-resources/rover-tutorial/#extensibility) to extend the functionality of your rover
- [Use the Viam mobile SDK to build an iOS or Android application](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/#mobile-sdk) to control the machine's components
