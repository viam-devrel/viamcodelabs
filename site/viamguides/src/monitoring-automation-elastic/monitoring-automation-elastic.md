<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

Please use [this markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viam-labs/viamcodelabs/master/site/viamguides/sample.md) as a template for writing your own Viam Codelab. This example guide has elements that you will use when writing your own guides, including: code snippet highlighting, downloading files, inserting photos, and more. 

It is important to include on the first page of your guide the following sections: Prerequisites, What you'll learn, What you'll need, and What you'll build. Remember, part of the purpose of a Viam Guide is that the reader will have **built** something by the end of the tutorial; this means that actual code needs to be included (not just pseudo-code).

The rest of this Viam Guide explains the steps of writing your own guide. 

### Prerequisites
