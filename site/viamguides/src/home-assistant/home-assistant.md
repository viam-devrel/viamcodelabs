# Set up people detection notifications in Home Assistant

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 1

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is one of the most popular smart home platforms in the world with a vast ecosystem of integrations to monitor and automate the devices around our homes.
The [Viam community integration](https://github.com/hipsterbrown/viam-home-assistant-integration) makes it possible to collect images and sensor data from those existing connected devices, train custom machine learning models, and run them locally as part of an automation workflow.

In this codelab, you'll learn how to install the integration through the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz) and use a [vision service](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision) to detect people from a camera connected to Home Assistant.

## Configure your machine

Duration: 3

### Create your machine

1. In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/dashboard) under the **LOCATIONS** tab, create a machine by typing in a name and clicking **Add machine**.
   ![add machine](assets/viam-add-machine.png)
1. Click **View setup instructions**.
   ![setup instructions](assets/viam-machine-setup.png)
1. To install `viam-server` on the Raspberry Pi device that you want to use to communicate with and control your webcam, select the `Linux / Aarch64` platform for the Raspberry Pi, and leave your installation method as [`viam-agent`](https://docs.viam.com/how-tos/provision-setup/#install-viam-agent).
   ![select platform](assets/viam-machine-install.png)
1. Use the `viam-agent` to download and install `viam-server` on your Raspberry Pi. Follow the instructions to run the command provided in the setup instructions from the SSH prompt of your Raspberry Pi.
   ![installation agent](assets/viam-agent.png)
1. The setup page will indicate when the machine is successfully connected.
   ![successful toast](assets/viam-machine-connected.png)

### Add an ML model service

1. In the Viam app, click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Service**, and then `ML model`.
   ![select ML model](assets/viam-config-ml-model.png)
1. Search for a module called `TFLite CPU`. Then click **Add module**, and **Create** a new [ML Model service](https://docs.viam.com/services/ml/) called `mlmodel-1`. This provides the ability to run Tensorflow Lite, a.k.a [LiteRT](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert), models on the machine.
   ![add module](assets/viam-config-tflite.png)
1. Notice this creates two new items in the left sidebar. The first is your new ML Model service called `mlmodel-1`, and the second is the `tflite_cpu` module from the Registry.
1. In the `mlmodel-1` panel, click "Select model" in the **Model** section, search for "COCO" under the **Registry** tab, and select the "EfficientDet-COCO" model from the list. This is a [general object detection model](https://research.google/pubs/efficientdet-scalable-and-efficient-object-detection/) that is very efficient, as the name implies, for resource-constrained devices like a Raspberry Pi.
   ![add model](assets/viam-model-select.png)
1. Click **Save** in the top right to save and apply your configuration changes.

### Add a vision service

1. In the Viam app, click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Service**, and then `vision`.
   ![select vision](assets/viam-config-vision.png)
1. Search for a module called `mlmodel`. Then click **Add module**, and **Create** a new [Vision service](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision/) called `vision-1`.
   ![add module](assets/viam-config-vision-name.png)
1. Notice adding this service adds the vision service called `vision-1`. From the **ML Model** section of the panel, select `mlmodel-1`.
   ![select ML model for vision service](assets/viam-config-vision-model.png)
1. **Save** your changes in the top right and wait a few moments for the configuration changes to take effect.
