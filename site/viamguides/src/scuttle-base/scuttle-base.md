# Build a SCUTTLE bot
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

Mobile robots come in all shapes and sizes, but most kits come with a pre-defined platform that are tough to change for custom use cases.
The [SCUTTLE](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/) (Sensing, Connected, Utility Transport Taxi for Level Environments) is a modular, open source robotics base for building mobile robots that puts you in control with 3D printed parts, extruded aluminum, and DIN railing.
When combined with Viam, you can compose hardware and software to build the smart, roving robot of your dreams.

## Set up your Raspberry Pi
Duration: 6

The Raspberry Pi boots from a microSD card. You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on the microSD card that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS
1. Connect the microSD card to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your Pi model, which is Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS LITE (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the USB flash drive you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
  ![raspberry pi storage](assets/raspberry-pi-imager.png)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `scuttle`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
  ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/raspberry-pi-image-settings.png)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
    ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/raspberry-pi-image-services.png)
    > aside negative
    > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on the microSD card. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to the microSD card.
1. Remove the microSD card from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it into an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
    ```bash
    ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
    ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
1. Update your Raspberry Pi to ensure all the latest packages are installed
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

### Enable communication protocols

1. Launch the Pi configuration tool by running the following command
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
1. Use your keyboard to select “Interface Options”, and press return.
    ![raspi config](assets/raspi-config-interface-options.png)
1. [Enable the relevant protocols](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#enable-communication-protocols) to support our hardware. Since you are using encoders that communicate over I<sup>2</sup>C, enable **I2C**.
  ![enable i2c](assets/raspi-config-i2c.png)
1. Confirm the options to enable the I<sup>2</sup>C interface. And shut down the Pi when you're finished.
    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -h now
    ```
