## Set up your Raspberry Pi
Duration: 5

The Raspberry Pi boots from a storage device, such as a USB flash drive or microSD card. You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on that storage device that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the storage device to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.webp)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the storage device you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.webp)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `test`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
   ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/generalSettings.webp)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
   ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/sshSettings.webp)
   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname`, `username`, and `password` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on your storage device. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to your storage device.
1. Remove the storage device from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the storage device into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
   > aside negative
   > Make sure you are using a 5V 3A USB-C power supply to power your Raspberry Pi 4. Using a power supply with inadequate amperage can lead to instability, throttling, or unexpected behavior. Additionally, while USB boot is enabled by default on newer Raspberry Pi 4 models, older versions may require a firmware update to enable it. Refer to the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html) for detailed setup instructions and compatibility.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
   ```bash
   ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
   ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
   ![raspberry pi SSH login](assets/sshLogin.webp)
1. Update your Raspberry Pi to ensure all the latest packages are installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
