## Delivery Plan - Hardware Assembly

Duration: 30

### Set up your plant watering device

Before programming the Pi to make the plant watering robot functional, you need to physically set up the plant watering robot by wiring the different components together. You will set up the robot to receive signals from the resistive soil moisture sensor and signal to the pump when it is time to pump water from the water’s container to the plant’s container.

Refer back to this full wiring diagram as you complete the steps to wire your hardware.

![Full Wiring Diagram](assets/plantWatering_bb.png)

> aside positive
> The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi.

Connect your Raspberry Pi to the moisture sensor module:

- Pin 4 (3V) to VCC (Power)
- Pin 6 (GND) to GND (Ground)
- Pin 40 (GPIO 21) to DO (Digital Output)

For connecting the soil moisture sensor to the sensor module, + goes to +, and - to -.

Connect your Raspberry Pi to the relay module:

- PIN 1 (3.3V) to COM
- PIN 2 (5V) to 5V
- PIN 14 (GND) to GND
- PIN 8 (GPIO 14) to IN

Last step in the wiring section is connecting the relay and Raspberry Pi to the pump. The wire connectors may be required to connect the jumper wires to the bare wires coming from the pump motor:

- NO (Normally Open) on the relay module to either of the pump motor wires
- GPIO 39 (GND) on the Raspberry Pi to the remaining pump motor wire

> aside negative
> You will need to use a small screwdriver to open and close the relay terminals. Make sure the terminals close tight around the jumper wires but don't break them.

Submerge the pump in the cup of water, making sure the wire connectors hang outside the the cup and don't touch the water. The legs of the moisture sensor can be placed in the other cup of soil or coffee grounds.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Delivery Plan - Hands-on Experiment

Duration: 40

### Test the moisture sensor

1. In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **CONTROL** tab, you can see the hardware component called `board-1`. That's your Raspberry Pi that you configured on the **CONFIGURE** tab.
   ![control tab](assets/controlTab.png)
1. The module we added has a `GetGPIO` function to get the digital output of a pin. Enter `40` in the "Pin" field, select the "Read" mode, and click "Get" for the "State" section under "READ PIN". "Low" means there is enough moisture, "High" means the moisture level has fallen below the threshold:
   ![read GPIO](assets/readGPIO.png)

   > aside negative
   > The moisture threshold is adjusted by turning the screw on the top of the sensor module. As you get into the Control interface of the Viam app, you can refine the threshold based on the needs of your plant.

   > aside negative
   > If any problems occur, check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.

### Test the pump

1. In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **CONTROL** tab, you can see the hardware component called `board-1`. That's your Raspberry Pi that you configured on the **CONFIGURE** tab.
   ![control tab](assets/controlTab.png)
1. The module we added has a `SetGPIO` function to set the digital output of a pin. Enter `8` in the "Pin" field, select the "Write" mode, then select "High" and click "Set" for the "State" section under "WRITE PIN". "High" will turn on the pump motor, "Low" will turn it off.
   ![write GPIO](assets/writeGPIO.png)

   > aside negative
   > If any problems occur, check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.

### Program your plant watering device

At this point, you have configured and tested your machine and peripherals, but nothing is happening automatically. In the next section, program your plant watering device to be a little smarter. Make your machine periodically get sensor data, turn on the pump motor if the value is low, and turn off again when the value is high.

![process diagram](assets/processDiagram.png)

### Create an automation script

1. To configure the machine to automatically run a command to execute a script, use a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/). Create a new file on your computer called `process.py`.

   On MacOS, Linux, or Windows WSL:

   ```bash
   touch process.py
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```cmd
   type nul > process.py
   ```

1. Copy and paste [this sample code](https://github.com/viam-labs/plant-watering-workshop/blob/main/plantwatering.py) into the new file `process.py`. This code will allow your Raspberry Pi to connect to both the sensor and pump and execute our logic.
1. Now it's time to move your control code to your Raspberry Pi device. [SSH into your Raspberry Pi](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#connect-with-ssh) if you're not already SSH'd.
1. From the SSH prompt on your Raspberry Pi, install the Python package manager.

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
   ```

1. Install the Viam Python SDK into a new directory called `process`.
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install --target=process viam-sdk
   ```
1. Display the full path of the current directory you are working in on your Raspberry Pi with the `pwd` command. Make a note of this output for the next steps.
   ```bash
   $ pwd
   ```
1. Find the executable path of Python3 to run `process.py` on your Raspberry Pi with `which python3`. Again, make a note of this output for the next steps.
   ```bash
   $ which python3
   ```
1. Run the following command from your computer (not the SSH prompt to your Raspberry Pi) to copy the code from your computer to your Raspberry Pi. In the command, you will copy `process.py` over to your Raspberry Pi, with the section following the colon `:` indicating where your file should be copied to on the Raspberry Pi (the path of the directory you are working in on your Raspberry Pi, along with the filename).
   ```bash
   $ scp process.py user@host.local:/home/myboard/process/process.py
   ```

<form>
  <name>What is the primary role of the `process.py` script in the plant watering system?</name>
  <input type="radio" value="To display moisture sensor readings directly on the Raspberry Pi.">
  <input type="radio" value="To define the logic for periodically checking sensor readings and toggling the pump.">
  <input type="radio" value="To update the firmware of the moisture sensor and motor pump.">
  <input type="radio" value="To configure the network settings for the Raspberry Pi.">
</form>

### Configure a Viam process

1.  Now let's allow `viam-server` to run the process as the root user on your Raspberry Pi by configuring a [Viam process](https://docs.viam.com/configure/processes/). In [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/fleet/locations) under the **CONFIGURE** tab, click the **+** icon in the left-hand menu and select **Process**.
1.  Find the corresponding card to `process-1`. Enter the executable path of Python3 running on your Raspberry Pi that you output from a previous step. Add an argument of the `process.py` file to run on your Raspberry Pi. Enter the working directory where you want the process to execute.
    ![configure process](assets/configureProcess.png)
1.  Still within the `process-1` card, select the advanced settings icon near the top right corner to review the configuration JSON. Create a new `env` property, and add your environment variables within the new property, formatted like the following with your own credentials.
    ```json
      "env": {
        "BOARD_NAME": "board-1",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ROBOT_API_KEY_ID": "your-api-key-id",
        "ROBOT_ADDRESS": "your-robot-address"
      },
    ```
    ![configure JSON](assets/configureJSON.png)
    > aside negative
    > The `BOARD_NAME` is the default name for the Raspberry Pi when added to our Viam machine. Other machine credentials can be found under the **CONNECT** tab, selecting an SDK, and toggling **Include API key** to reveal your credentials within the code sample.
        ![get credentials](assets/getCredentials.png)
1.  **Save** your updates.
1.  You can test the code by updating the `process.py` file on your Raspberry Pi to swap the logic for the `detect_moisture` value from the pin connected to the moisture sensor. **Save** your code changes, and **Restart** the machine to see if the pump motor turns on when the plant has enough water.
    ![restart the machine](assets/restartMachine.png)
    > aside negative
    > You can either edit the file on your computer and copy the updated file over to your Raspberry Pi using `scp` like we did previously. Or you can use the default command-line text editor on Raspberry Pi OS `nano` by entering `nano process.py` from the SSH prompt.
    > ![edit in Nano](assets/editNano.png)
    > Alternatively, you can try removing water from the soil with a paper towel or lifting the sensor from the soil.

## Additional resources and troubleshooting

Duration: 5

### Additional resources

- The website [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) is a helpful resource with the exact layout and role of each pin for Raspberry Pi. When working with Viam, make sure to reference the physical pin numbers, and not the GPIO numbers listed on `pinout.xyz`.
- The [demo video](https://youtu.be/Q6UuUKJpDn0?feature=shared) provides a brief overview of the project.
- Viam APIs provide consistent methods of working with components, such as a [`board`](https://docs.viam.com/components/board/#api), [`camera`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#api), and services, such as [`computer vision`](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision/#api). Refer to the [Viam documentation](https://docs.viam.com/platform/) for API reference for all components and services.
- Besides Python, Viam provides [SDKs in various programming languages](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/) to write control code for the backend, frontend, and mobile applications.

<img src="assets/service.png" alt="service icon" width="200">

### Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance

1. **Safety**
   - Be careful when working with water around powered electrical components. Mixing them could result in them breaking.
1. **Security**
   - Do not share your API credentials publicly. Sharing this information could compromise your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your machine, or to the computer running your machine.
1. **Flashing firmware**
   - Make sure you are using a 5V 3A (25W) power supply.
   - Participants must remember the `hostname` and `username` they set while flashing their Raspberry Pi, as they will need this when they SSH into the Pi.
   - To save time, instructors can flash all the Pis ahead of time with pre-determined credentials and share the credentials with participants during the workshop. Each Pi should have a unique `hostname` to avoid conflicts on the shared local network, such as `&lt;student-name&gt;-planter` or `&lt;group-name&gt;-planter` if they are working in groups.
     - If you're using SD cards, verify that you have a way to write data onto them before providing them to participants.
1. **Configuring machine and peripherals**
   - If any problems occur while setting up the machine and peripherals in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com), check under the **LOGS** tab to see what might be going wrong.
   - Check that all wires are securely attached to the correct pins.
   - Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the board there.
   - Also refer to the overall [Viam troubleshooting guide](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/troubleshooting/).

<img src="assets/viam-rasp.png" alt="raspberry pi icon" width="200">

### Logistics for continued learning

Participants have several options for continuing their projects beyond the workshop environment:

- **Take-home projects**: For participants allowed to take their project home after the workshop, the `viam-agent` on the Raspberry Pi can simplify the setup process:

  - **Provisioning mode**: Upon rebooting the Raspberry Pi in a new environment like at home, the `viam-agent` automatically creates a Wi-Fi hotspot if it cannot connect to a known network.
  - **Connect to the hotspot**: Look for a network named `viam-setup-HOSTNAME` in your list of available Wi-Fi networks, where `HOSTNAME` is the custom hostname you set during the workshop, and `viamsetup` is the default password. Connect your laptop to this network.
  - **Provide network information for the machine**: Go to the provisioning portal at `http://viam.setup/` in a browser to follow [the on-screen instructions](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/provision/#end-user-experience) to configure the Raspberry Pi for your home Wi-Fi.

- **Remote control**: If participants cannot take their device home but want to continue their projects, they can access it remotely:

  - **Access the workshop device**: Participants can control the workshop device remotely from anywhere in the world. A webcam can be set up for participants to view the device activation in real time.
  - **Code from home**: Without SSH access to the Raspberry Pi, participants can still write and test code on their laptops and integrate changes during their next in-person session or via workshop-provided tools.

### Next-level projects

Here are some ideas for expanding and enhancing the current project to create autonomous behaviors.

- [Train a custom ML model](https://docs.viam.com/how-tos/train-deploy-ml/) guide: to enable classification to recognize when your plant is healthy or not.
- [Use the Viam mobile SDK to build an iOS or Android application](https://docs.viam.com/sdks/#mobile-sdk) to control the machine's components.
- [Create an smart plant assistant](https://youtu.be/l4MQRiHPY6Y?feature=shared) using voice control and a local LLM.
