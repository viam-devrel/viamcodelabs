# Real-Time Object Detection with Raspberry Pi AI HAT

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 1

The Raspberry Pi 5 is a very useful and adaptable platform for various embedded and edge computing applications. However, when working with computer vision models, the performance on the single board computer can lack in either accuracy, speed, or both.
To address this use case, the Raspberry Pi company released the [Raspberry Pi AI Kit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-kit/) and [Raspberry Pi AI HAT+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat/) with dedicated neural network accelerators.

## Set up your Raspberry Pi

Duration: 5

The Raspberry Pi boots from a microSD card. You need to install Raspberry Pi OS on the microSD card that you will use with your Pi. For more details about alternative methods of setting up your Raspberry Pi, refer to the [Viam docs](https://docs.viam.com/installation/prepare/rpi-setup/#install-raspberry-pi-os).

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Connect the microSD card to your computer.
1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and launch it.
   ![raspberry pi imager](assets/imager.png)
1. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**. Select your model of Pi, which is Raspberry Pi 5.
1. Click **CHOOSE OS**. Select **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** from the menu.
1. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**. From the list of devices, select the microSD card you intend to use in your Raspberry Pi.
   ![raspberry pi storage](assets/osSelect.png)
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Click **Next**. When prompted to apply OS customization settings, select **EDIT SETTINGS**.
1. Check **Set hostname** and enter the name you would like to access the Pi by in that field, for example, `test`.
1. Select the checkbox for **Set username and password** and set a username (for example, your first name) that you will use to log into the Pi. If you skip this step, the default username will be `pi` (not recommended for security reasons). And specify a password.
1. Connect your Pi to Wi-Fi so that you can run `viam-server` wirelessly. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your wireless network credentials. SSID (short for Service Set Identifier) is your Wi-Fi network name, and password is the network password. Change the section `Wireless LAN country` to where your router is currently being operated.
   ![raspberry pi hostname username and password](assets/generalSettings.png)
1. Select the **SERVICES** tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
   ![raspberry pi enable SSH](assets/sshSettings.png)
   > aside negative
   > Be sure that you remember the `hostname` and `username` you set, as you will need this when you SSH into your Pi.
1. **Save** your updates, and confirm `YES` to apply OS customization settings. Confirm `YES` to erase data on the USB flash drive. You may also be prompted by your operating system to enter an administrator password. After granting permissions to the Imager, it will begin writing and then verifying the Linux installation to the USB flash drive.
1. Remove the USB flash drive from your computer when the installation is complete.

### Connect with SSH

1. Place the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi and boot the Pi by plugging it in to an outlet. A red LED will turn on to indicate that the Pi is connected to power.
1. Once the Pi is started, connect to it with SSH. From a command line terminal window, enter the following command. The text in <> should be replaced (including the < and > symbols themselves) with the user and hostname you configured when you set up your Pi.
   ```bash
   ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME>.local
   ```
1. If you are prompted “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”, type “yes” and hit enter. Then, enter the password for your username. You should be greeted by a login message and a command prompt.
   ![raspberry pi SSH login](assets/sshLogin.png)
1. Update your Raspberry Pi to ensure all the latest packages are installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

With the OS installed, it's time to set up the system packages for the AI HAT+.

### Building advanced scenarios with Viam and the Raspberry Pi AI HAT+

At this point, you have created an edge device that can perform real-time object detection and monitor it remotely from anywhere! You can keep building on this project with additional features:

- Model out a smart city control system by connecting [red, yellow, and green LEDs](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/led-blink/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) to the Pi for simulated traffic light control.
- Make your smart home even smarter by [integrating with Home Assistant](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/home-assistant/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)
- Put it on a rover and [make it mobile](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/drive-rover-ts/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

The default [YOLO-based models](https://www.viam.com/post/guide-yolo-model-real-time-object-detection-with-examples) can do more than detect traffic! You can find the full list of identifiable objects included in the module repo: [https://github.com/HipsterBrown/viam-pi-hailo-ml/](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/viam-pi-hailo-ml/blob/main/assets/coco.txt)

If none of those items suit your project requirements, you can explore the full suite of model types in the [Hailo Model Zoo](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo/blob/master/docs/PUBLIC_MODELS.rst) or [retrain a model](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo/blob/master/training/yolov8/README.rst) on a custom dataset.

In addition to the project ideas mentioned above, consider other ways to continue your journey with Viam.

- Browse other modules in [the Viam registry](https://app.viam.com/registry) similar to the [prebuilt module for the AI HAT+](https://github.com/hipsterbrown/viam-pi-hailo-ml).
- Learn [how to create your own module](https://docs.viam.com/how-tos/hello-world-module/) with custom functionality for other computer vision runtimes or models.
